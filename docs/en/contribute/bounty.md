# Bounty Program

## About
As part of our commitment to open source, and building an active community around Homebox (and hopefully active pool of developers), we are enabling bounties on issues.

After digging through several platforms we ended up settling on [boss.dev](https://www.boss.dev/) as it has some of the lowest fees we could possibly find for any of these platforms other than spinning one up ourselves (which we currently aren't in a position to do).

While it's not the perfect solution, we think it's about the best one we could find at the moment to lower the rates as much as possible to make sure everyone get's the highest payouts possible. (Some we found were as high as a combined 16%!!!)

We hope that by enabling bounties on issues that people who have the means and want certain features implemented quicker can sponsor issues, and in turn everyone contributing code can potentially earn some money for their hard work.

## Contributor
